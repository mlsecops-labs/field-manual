# **Preface: How the MLSecOps Field Manual Was Built**

The MLSecOps Field Manual is the product of a **new style of engineering**—one that blends human expertise with AI-assisted development. This reflects the reality of modern AI and security work, where researchers and practitioners increasingly collaborate with intelligent tools.

Throughout this project, AI systems were used as:

* brainstorming partners
* code assistants
* debugging tools
* research accelerators
* drafting aids for documentation

But the true backbone of the system—its infrastructure, experimental modules, architectures, and insights—was developed hands-on in a multi-node MLSecOps Lab built and operated by the author.

Every module presented in the Manual has been:

* implemented
* tested
* reproduced
* documented
* and fully understood

before publication.

The intent is not to present “AI-generated work,” but rather to demonstrate **AI-augmented engineering**—a realistic workflow that mirrors how modern technical teams operate.

This Field Manual is ultimately a **human project**, built by a security engineer using modern tools to push into a rapidly evolving discipline.
