MLSecOps Field Manual™ – Concept (Working Draft)

A Living, Open, Practical Contribution to the AI Security Community

---
1. Mission

Build a long-term, public, reproducible library of small, practical MLSecOps modules—each demonstrating real attacks, defenses, monitoring, secure patterns, and failure modes—grounded in a realistic private lab and focused on elevating the field through operational clarity.

This is not a product, not a course, and not a “big launch.”
This is a slow, steady, high-signal contribution to a field in desperate need of grounded guidance.

The Field Manual™ exists to:

distill complex ML security concepts into runnable examples

translate theory into operational practice

help engineers and practitioners understand real attack surfaces

provide reproducible artifacts for education and red-teaming

create a foundation the community can build on

advance MLSecOps as a discipline through clarity and honesty


This is your public legacy.


---

2. Philosophy

The Field Manual is guided by four principles:

Reality over polish

Each module must be based on something you actually ran in your lab.
No hypotheticals, no idealized scenarios.

Reproducibility over complexity

Small, self-contained modules beat large, monolithic labs.
Anyone should be able to learn something in 10–20 minutes.

Operational clarity over academic abstraction

Show logs.
Show metrics.
Show what broke.
Explain why.
Ground everything in real systems.

Incremental contribution over big releases

One module every 2–4 weeks beats waiting a year for a perfect release.
Knowledge compounds.


---

3. The Three-Pillar Structure

Pillar 1 — Private Lab (Your R&D Engine)

Your Proxmox cluster, GPU nodes, VLAN segmentation, services, RAG stack, Agentic AI pipelines, and future VMs.

This is where:

you run attacks

test defenses

observe logs

build secure patterns

trigger failure modes

experiment with LLM threats

execute unsafe agent behaviors

break things deliberately


The public never sees this directly.
This is your forge.


---

Pillar 2 — Public Modules (Your Contribution)

These are the small, polished, runnable artifacts you publish.

Each module is:

1 attack or defense

1 monitoring demonstration

1 architecture pattern

1 failure mode

1 red-team scenario

1 RAG or Agentic AI safety example


Each is:

short

clear

easy to run

grounded in evidence

useful in isolation


These become the core “chapters” of the Field Manual.


---

Pillar 3 — Patterns & Anti-Patterns Library (Your Long-Term Legacy)

A long-lived public knowledge base containing:

Patterns:

secure model loading

safe RAG ingestion

agent tool-permission design

inference gateway patterns

drift + anomaly monitoring

secure embedding pipelines

GPU isolation practices


Anti-patterns:

unsafe pickle loading

agent with unrestricted tool access

retrieval poisoning

prompt injection via retrieval

misconfigured inference endpoints

poor drift detection setups

brittle preprocessing pipelines


These documents grow slowly over months and years.
They become durable references.


---

4. Scope of the Manual

The Field Manual covers the complete MLSecOps landscape, but not all at once.

It grows across:

Classic ML Threats

evasion attacks

poisoning attacks

membership inference

model extraction

gradient-based attacks


Defenses

adversarial training

input sanitization

detection algorithms

architectural hardening


Monitoring & Drift

data drift

concept drift

embedding drift

live metrics

alerting patterns


Secure Deployment

model gateways

inference firewalls

API mediation

logging and SIEM integration

GPU workload isolation


Supply-Chain Safety

unsafe model serialization

dependency attacks

malicious weights

model provenance

secure loading patterns


LLM Security

jailbreak demos

jailbreak detection

prompt injection variants

guard model examples


RAG Security

retrieval poisoning

metadata attacks

embedding drift

secure indexing patterns

safe retriever design


Agentic AI Safety

unsafe tool access

agent hallucinated actions

execution sandboxing

permission boundaries

agent loop failure modes


Each of these topics becomes a slow, steady addition—not a single massive release.


---

5. Publishing Cadence

You avoid burnout and maximize impact by pacing the work:

Every 2–4 weeks

Publish one module:
A notebook or short markdown walkthrough.

Every 2–3 months

Publish a Pattern or Anti-Pattern page.

Every 6–12 months

Publish a compiled “Edition”: MLSecOps Field Manual – Edition 2026, etc.

This cadence fits:

your job

your learning curve

your lab build-out

your five-year plan


and ensures you contribute continuously without overwhelming yourself.


---

6. Year One Goals (Realistic & Impactful)

By end of year one, you will have:

6–12 public modules

2–4 patterns & anti-patterns

a public GitHub project with steady contributions

a growing audience of engineers, researchers, practitioners

a credible presence in MLSecOps

a repeatable framework for publishing

a private lab capable of 80% of what you need


This is a strong, realistic foundation.


---

7. How This Advances the Field

The Field Manual fills four critical gaps:

1. Reproducible ML security knowledge
Nearly nonexistent today.

2. Operational clarity that connects theory to practice
Your real lab makes this possible.

3. Security practitioner perspective in a ML-dominated space
Rare and deeply needed.

4. Slow, steady accumulation of high-signal artifacts
The opposite of throwaway hype.

Your work becomes a reference others use:

in workshops

in classrooms

in companies

in red-teaming exercises

in research repos

in open-source libraries

in conference talks


You become one of the people building the foundation the community stands on.


---

8. How This Supports Your Personal Five-Year Plan

This strategy is perfectly aligned with your long-term independence goals.

It generates:

reputation

credibility

technical depth

industry visibility

blogging topics

conference material

potential collaborators

future consulting clients

future workshop attendees


Your contributions compound over years and position you as a trustworthy, evidence-driven MLSecOps practitioner.

9. Initial Module Roadmap (First 6–9 Modules)

Module 1 — Evasion Attack: Logs + Mitigation

A simple FGSM or PGD demo with clean metrics and detection.

Module 2 — Safe Model Loading

Pickle → ONNX → TorchScript comparison with real risk examples.

Module 3 — LLM Jailbreak + Logging + Simple Mitigation

Realistic, grounded, no hype.

Module 4 — Retrieval Poisoning (RAG)

Minimal reproducer showing how a single poisoned document steers outputs.

Module 5 — Embedding Drift Detection

Show monitoring patterns and failure modes.

Module 6 — Agent Tool Misconfiguration Demo

Show how an agent executes an unintended action.

Module 7 — Inference Gateway Hardening

Simple pattern for secure inference endpoints.

Module 8 — Drift + SIEM Integration

Forward drift events to a log pipeline.

Module 9 — Anti-Pattern: What Not to Do in ML Security

Unsafe patterns drawn from your own experiments.

---

10. Long-Term Vision

Over 3–5 years, the Field Manual becomes:

a respected repository

a slow-grown knowledge base

a reproducible lab for others

a reference for secure AI deployments

a foundation that outlives any individual module
