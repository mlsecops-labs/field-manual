# MLSecOps Field Manual

This repository is the public-facing MLSecOps Field Manual: curated guidance, opinionated checklists, and reproducible examples for securing machine learning systems. It distills battle-tested practices while keeping enough detail for practitioners to implement them.

## Relationship to the MLSecOps Lab
- The **MLSecOps Lab** (private) is the sandbox for experiments, red/blue exercises, and living research notes.
- The **Field Manual** (this repo) is the hardened, shareable output from the Lab: cleaned write-ups, reference architectures, playbooks, and supporting diagrams.
- Changes typically incubate in the Lab first, then graduate here once validated.

## Repository layout
- `docs/growth-map/` – roadmap, capability maturity, and learning tracks.
- `docs/drafts/` – in-progress narratives and experiments being prepared for publication.
- `docs/book/` – structured book-ready chapters and sections.
- `docs/diagrams/` – visual assets and architecture diagrams.
- `docs/website/` – site sources for publishing the manual.

## Contributing
Issues and pull requests are welcome for clarifications, errata, and small improvements. For deeper contributions, please propose structure changes first so we keep the manual cohesive.
